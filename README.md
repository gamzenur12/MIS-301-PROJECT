# MIS-301-PROJECT
There are a lot of people who want to spend their time but get lost on the internet while researching what they want to do. What we want to do in this project is to prepare a guide that guides people when they want to make use of their time. Before preparing the project, we listened to the complaints of the people around us about this issue and we decided to establish a "time evaluation site a.k.a AmazingGorgeousGenius" considering how we can do something. The site that we have prepared is only user-logged, so we created a user-friendly site. We stood on 3 platforms on this site. These;

- A hobby page that allows people to make use of their time and get a new job (Hobby Street)
- "What am I going to watch?" Instead of getting lost on the internet by asking, an online series and movie library that brings together the most outstanding series and movies (Digital Rejoicing)
- An online education guide for beginners for every person who wants to add something to themselves and improve themselves. (Learnbox)

First of all, we researched what content should be on these 3 pages and which software languages we should use while preparing the project.

Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code was used for HTML and CSS codes. In the HTML part, the articles on the web page were added, and in the CSS part, a design appealing to the HTML files was given.

PHP: PHP was used to add and pull it into the database login, registration and user information on the home page.

phpMyAdmin: The phpMyAdmin software platform was used to keep the information of people who registered on the web page.

Xampp: The Xampp software platform was used to link the database where the users' information is stored and the prepared web pages.

Mobile : We have also created the mobile layout of our website so that users can access our site from anywhere at any time. You can see the generated codes for mobile layout in @media tags in CSS.
